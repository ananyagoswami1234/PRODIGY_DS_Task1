üåç World Population Data Analysis: A Comprehensive Study (1960-2023) üìä

I am excited to share my latest project, "World Population Data Analysis," which I completed as part of my internship at Prodigy Infotech. This analysis delves into the World Bank's population dataset, exploring trends and patterns over six decades (1960-2023).

üîç Project Overview:
The primary objective was to understand the population distribution, regional distribution, and income group distribution over the years, providing valuable insights for policy-making, economic planning, and demographic studies.

üìä Key Analyses & Visualizations:

Population Distribution Over the Years: Histograms for each year from 1960 to 2023, showcasing how population values are spread across different countries.
Total Population Per Year: A horizontal bar chart illustrating the overall growth trend of the world population from 1960 to 2023.
Country-wise Population Analysis:
Top 20 Countries by Population in 1960 and 2023: Bar charts highlighting the countries with the highest populations at the start and end of the dataset.
Regional Distribution: A bar chart showing the distribution of countries across different regions.
Income Group Distribution by Region: Count plots visualizing the economic distribution of countries within various regions.
Word Cloud of Special Notes: A visual representation of the most common terms and phrases in the special notes column.
Income Group vs. Special Notes Length: A scatter plot exploring the correlation between the length of special notes and income groups.
Income Group vs. Age: A scatter plot visualizing the age distribution within different income groups using randomly generated age data.
Gender Distribution: Bar charts showing gender distribution by region and income group, based on randomly generated gender data.

üìà Data Sources:
Population Data: API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_433762.csv
Metadata: Metadata_Country_API_SP.POP.TOTL_DS2_en_csv_v2_433762.csv

üìö Conclusion:
This comprehensive analysis sheds light on the world population trends, regional distributions, and economic group patterns over the years. 
The insights derived can aid in informed decision-making and strategic planning.
